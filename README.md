# Reproduction of Rari Finance hack

## Description
This is a reproduction of the Rari Finance hack on April 30 2022, using on-chain fuzzing with Echidna.

We're using a single invariant which checks if an actor is able to increase their balance by an unreasonably large amount. We have a basic set of functions such as `mint`, `borrow` and `exitMarket`, etc. Since the hack involves reentrancy, we've implemented rudementary reentrancy support in [EchidnaReentrancy](src/echidna/EchidnaReentrancy.sol).

After running for approximately 30 minutes (1 worker), we can detect a significant increase in funds for the attacking actor. The shrunk sequence can be seen below.

```
